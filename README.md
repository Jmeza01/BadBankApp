# BadBankApp
MIT xPRO Full Stack Application Project


BadBank is a banking application created as part of my coursework for the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development w/ MERN Certificate Program. It was developed using React, Express, Node and MongoDB.

Installation Guidelines: Install utilizing git clone. Initialize node.js module.

Technology Used: React.js, Express, Node, MongoDB

Features: The project currently features pages to create an account, login, deposit, withdraw and to check balances. In the future, I would like to reauthenticate so that deposit, withdraw and balance pages are hidden until a user successfully logs in.
